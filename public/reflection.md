## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with three to five sentences.

1. **Variable Declaration**  
   I understood and learned how to declare variables in JavaScript using `let`, `const`, and `var`. I know when to use each one depending on whether the value will change or not. This has been made clear to me because Sir showed us lots of examples that showcased the storing of numbers, strings, and boolean values inside variables.

2. **JavaScript Operations**  
   I know how to use arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` in solving problems. These are very similar to math operations, which made them easy to understand. We also practiced logical operators like `&&` and `||`, which are useful in combining conditions. I also learned and somehow mastered to know when to use the said operations. 

3. **JavaScript Basic Statements**  
   I am confident with basic statements like `console.log()` for output and `readline` for input. I also understand assignment statements where we store results into variables. These basic statements are the foundation of every program we wrote. This knowledge had been crucial for me to understand the fundamentals of javascript.

4. **Control Statements**  
   I know how to use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to control the flow of a program. For example, I can write conditions to check divisibility rules or compare numbers. Practicing with real examples and problems made me understand how important control statements are in decision-making.

5. **Loop Control Structures**  
   I understand `for` and `while` loops, and I know when to use them. I can use `for` loops when I know the number of repetitions and `while` loops when I need to repeat until a condition is met. We also practiced nested loops, which helped me make number series and star patterns.

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but need further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed.

1. **Variable Declaration**  
   I know how to declare variables, but sometimes I can get confused about the differences between `let`, `const`, and `var`. I need more practice in choosing the best one in different situations.  

2. **JavaScript Operations**  
   I understand arithmetic operators, but I need more practice with logical and comparison operators. Sometimes I get mixed up with combining multiple conditions most of the time. This leads me to be unfamiliar with how combined operations should look like. 

3. **JavaScript Basic Statements**  
   I can use statements like `console.log()`, but I need more practice using input methods in Node.js, like `readline`. I sometimes forget the syntax and I have a poor foundation of understanding for this. I only have memorized the code to get an input, I don't fully understand why it should be so. 

4. **Control Statements**  
   I know how to use `if-else`, but I need more practice handling multiple conditions and nested `if` statements. Sometimes I get lost in the logic. I still can't differentiate clearly if-else and else-if.

5. **Loop Control Structures**  
   I understand loops, but I need further practice with nested loops. Complex problems like creating aligned patterns or grids are still difficult for me. Sometimes, I understand the question and recognize that it would require loops, but I don't know how to implement it.

## Describe what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

1. For variable declaration, I will practice writing small programs using `let`, `const`, and `var` in different situations.  
2. For JavaScript operations, I will solve exercises that combine logical and comparison operators.  
3. For basic statements, I will review the correct syntax for input and output in Node.js and apply them in my small programs.  
4. For control statements, I will create practice problems with multiple conditions and nested if statements.  
5. For loop control structures, I will practice coding star patterns, number series, and nested loops until I become more confident.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

1. **Effective: Discussing meticulously and showing how what was taught can be applied**  
   Sometimes, teachers don't really have a grasp of a class' capacity and don't know if a specific topic should be discussed completely of just skimmed over. I think what was effective was actually defining and showing concepts, then applying it in various problems. 

2. **Effective: Star Pattern Bonus**  
   This was effective because it made me apply nested loops step by step. It was challenging but very useful for strengthening my loop logic. This was initially very tricky for me, but since it became a bonus activity, I pushed myself to understand it and write a code for it. 

3. **Not Effective: Copying Code from Examples**  
   Copying code without enough explanation was not effective because I was not practicing my problem-solving. It made me rely on examples instead of understanding.  

4. **Not Effective: Very Short Quizzes**  
   Quizzes with only simple problems were not effective in checking my understanding. I needed more varied and harder problems to test my skills.
