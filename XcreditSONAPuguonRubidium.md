# Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.
### by Shekinah Marcel F. Puguon - 9 Rubidium

## Key Points I Found Interesting:
- The 2.5 million previously unelectrified households now having power. 
- Focus on agriculture modernization and helping small farmers.
- Emphasis on digitalization of government services.
- The boost of the renewable energy sector for sustainability.

## Key Points I Found Weird:
- I feel like the Siquijor power crisis reaching the point of state of calamity due to expired permits, faulty generators, and mismanagement is something that could've been prevented much earlier.
- The overemphasis of Zumba and Car-free Sundays as national strategies to prevent obesity seems extremely light compared to more pressing health issues. 
- It doesn't feel authentic enough when BBM cites numbers and percentages but barely mentions specific sites and areas that were benefited by the said actions. The claims aren't visible to the masses. 
- Repetitive slogans like "Build, Better, More" and "Bagong Pilipinas" feel stale or overly used. 

## Reflection:

President Marcos Jr.â€™s SONA this year highlighted many progressive and ambitious programs. It is very much appreciated how he covered a wide range of people to ensure that all categories are mentioned. Many real issues that affect ordinary Filipinos such as the lack of electricity, poor water service, and education gaps were all mentioned in this speech. A lot of problems were directly given specific solutions to. The president also presented many programs including free college, digital resources, and Tesda expansion, which can uplift the lives of many people if followed through. 

However, some parts of the SONA felt underdeveloped and somewhat incomplete. The focus on Zumba to solve adult obesity seemed trivial in a way compared to bigger health problems. Many issues including the Siquijor crisis revealed how mismanagement truly haunts public services. I do hope tho that behind the polished delivery, the government truly pushes real and consistent improvement, upholding the sake of the people. More than new programs, what we do need is honest follow-through and visible change. 

## ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ My One Word for the Philippines:
**best wishes, Philippines**
